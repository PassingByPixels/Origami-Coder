   - For example, before running "mkdir foo/bar", first use \`ls foo\` to check that "foo" exists and is the intended parent directory

2. Command Execution:
   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., rm "path with spaces/file.txt")
   - Examples of proper quoting:
     - mkdir "/Users/name/My Documents" (correct)
     - mkdir /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)

   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.
   - Capture the output of the command.

Usage notes:
  - The command argument is required.
  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds. If not specified, commands will time out after ${defaultTimeoutMs}ms. The largest timeout you can ask for is ${MAX_TIMEOUT_MS}ms. Anything longer than that must run as a background task through the task tool, not as a blocking call here.

You can use Read with offset/limit to read specific sections or Grep to search the full content. Do NOT use \`head\`, \`tail\`, or other truncation commands to limit output; the full output will already be captured to a file for more precise searching.

  - Avoid using Bash with the \`find\`, \`grep\`, \`cat\`, \`head\`, \`tail\`, \`sed\`, \`awk\`, or \`echo\` commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:

    - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)
    - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)
    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)
